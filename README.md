My Command line interface allows the user to learn about any of the professional football stadiums in the United States. The user can view lists sorted by the year the stadium opened, the capacity of the stadium or, go directly to a specific stadium's detailed profile by entering either their zip code or the stadium's name. I used information from  https://simple.wikipedia.org to identify the locations of zip codes entered, and https://www.sportingnews.com to add some personailty to the experience by offering posted real-life, anonymous impressions of the venues. The official stadium information was gathered from https://en.wikipedia.org. Please note: the program has been coded to define terminal dimensions.
