My Command line interface allows the user to learn about any of the professional football stadiums in the United States. The user can view lists sorted by the year the stadium opened, the capacity of the stadium or, go directly to a specific stadium's detailed profile by either entering their zip code or the stadium's name. I used information from  https://simple.wikipedia.org to identify the locations of  zip codes entered, and https://www.sportingnews.com, to add some personailty to the experience by offering posted anonymous impressions of the venues. The official  stadium information was gathered from https://en.wikipedia.org.
